# Completed Items
 1. Done with backend part (with middleware, validations )
 2. Created two routes on Frontend Part (api/) for Create Bills and (api/bills) for Get Bills

# Pending Items
Just need to bind the get Bills structure in Table Format (Binded half data)
Created extra api for get Bills by Id but didn't implement on frontend part.

# Approach
1. Created Backend First with models, controllers and routes and validation also.
2. Tested Api's in Postman
3. Implemented APi's on Frontend with axios and binded the data in table format

# Backend Detail Approach
1. Created one bill Schema with items so that i shouldn't need to create another schema for items.
2. Created - create and get and getById for Bills so that bill can create easily with multiple items
3. Then setup React with Vite and created two routes for Create Bills and Get Bills
